	<p>The following notices provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website <code>https://searchhub.io</code> and other subdomains owned and run by CXP Commerce Experts GmbH <br>(company number DE 296944558). Personal data is any data that can be used to identify you personally. For detailed information on data protection, please refer to our privacy policy listed below this text. </p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Data collection on this website</h5>

<h6 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</h6>

<p>Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find his contact details in the section "Note on the responsible office" in this data protection declaration.</p>

<h6 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">How do we collect your data?</h6>

<p>On the one hand, your data is collected by you providing it to us. This may, for example, be data that you enter in a contact form.</p>

<p>Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. Internet browser, operating system or time of page view). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>

<h6 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">What do we use your data for?</h6>

<p>Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>

<h6 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">What rights do you have regarding your data?</h6>

<p>You have the right at any time to receive information free of charge about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have a right to request that this data be corrected or deleted. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>

<p>For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of data protection, you can contact us at any time.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Analysis tools and third-party tools</h5>

<p>When visiting this website, your surfing behavior may be statistically analyzed. This is done primarily with so-called analysis programs.</p>

<p>Detailed information on these analysis programs can be found in the following privacy policy.</p>

<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Hosting</h4>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">External Hosting</h5>

<p>This website is hosted by an external service provider (hoster). The personal data collected on this website is stored on the hoster's servers. This may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contractual data, contact details, names, website accesses and other data generated via a website.</p>

<p>The hoster is used for the purpose of fulfilling contracts with our potential and existing customers (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO) and in the interest of a secure, fast and efficient provision of our online offer by a professional provider (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO).</p>

<p>Our hoster will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfill its service obligations and follow our instructions regarding this data.</p>

<p>We use the following hoster:</p>

<p>1&1 Telecommunication SE
	<br>Elgendorfer Str. 57 
	<br>56410 Montabaur</p>


<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">General notes and mandatory information</h4>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Data protection</h5>

<p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration.</p>

<p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>

<p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Note on the responsible office</h5>

<p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>

<p>CXP COMMERCE EXPERTS GMBH
	<br>Am Schoßgatter 3
	<br>75172 Pforzheim
	<br>
	<br>Phone: +49 7231 203-676-5
	<br>E-mail: info@commerce-experts.com</p>

<p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Storage period</h5>

<p>Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, or our cookie consent policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h5>

<p>Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Revocation of your consent to data processing.</h5>

<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO).</h5>

<p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21(1) DSGVO).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority.</h5>

<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Right to data portability</h5>

<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">SSL or TLS encryption</h5>

<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>

<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Information, deletion and correction</h5>

<p>Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to receive free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients and the purpose of data processing and, if applicable, the right to have this data corrected or deleted. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Right to restriction of processing</h5>

<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>

  <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.</li>
        <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>


<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Objection to advertising e-mails</h5>

<p>We hereby object to the use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation to send advertising and information material that has not been expressly requested. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p>

<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Data collection on this website</h4>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Cookies</h5>

<p>Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text files and do not cause any damage to your end device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser.</p>

<p>Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text files and do not cause any damage to your end device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser.</p>

<p>In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored on your terminal device when you enter our site (third-party cookies). These enable us or you to use certain services of the third-party company (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).</p>

<p>Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies are used to evaluate user behavior or display advertising.</p>

<p>Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process (necessary cookies) or to provide certain functions that you have requested (functional cookies, e.g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e.g. cookies to measure the web audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies has been requested, the storage of the cookies in question is based exclusively on this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>

<p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>

<p>Insofar as cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes, we will inform you separately about this within the scope of this data protection declaration and, if necessary, request your consent.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Server log files</h5>

<p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>

<ul>
        <li>browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>operating system used</li>
        <li>referrer URL</li>
        <li>host name of the accessing computer</li>
	<li>IP address</li>
</ul>


<p>A combination of this data with other data sources is not made.</p>

<p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website - for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.</p>

<br>
	    
<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">3rd Party Processors</h5>

<p>We share data with several 3rd parties for the purposes of processing data (in some instances personal data) on our behalf.</p>

<ul>
        <li>Google Analytics - privacy policy https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB</li>
        <li>Cloudflare - privacy policy https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/</li>
        <li>LinkedIn - privacy policy https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy</li>
	<li>Hubspot (usemessages) - privacy policy https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Inquiry by e-mail, telephone or fax</h5>

<p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>

<p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) if this has been requested.</p>

<p>The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular legal retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Contact form</h5>

<p>Should you contact us via a form on the website, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you voluntarily provide, to follow-up with your request and provide you with the requested services. Additionally, we use the information we collect to communicate with you about relevant updates and to market our website, newsletter and products. We do not share this information without your permission and you may opt out at any time. </p>

<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>

<p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Demographic data collection by Google Analytics.</h5>

<p> This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection".</p>


<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">WordPress Stats</h4>

<p>This website uses the WordPress Stats tool to perform statistical analyses of visitor traffic. This service is provided by Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street # 343, San Francisco, CA 94110-4929, USA.</p>

<p>WordPress Stats uses cookies that are stored on your computer and allow an analysis of the use of the website. The information generated by the cookies about the use of our website is stored on servers in the USA. Your IP address will be anonymized after processing and before storage.</p>

<p>WordPress Stats cookies remain on your device until you delete them.</p>

<p>The storage of "WordPress Stats" cookies is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>

<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.

<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Google Analytics Remarketing</h4>

<p>Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

<p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>

<p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p>

<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>

<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.</p>

<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.</p>

<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h4>

<p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google”).</p>

<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>

<p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>

<p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>

<p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/.</p>

<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>

<h4 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Newsletter</h4>

<h5 class="block-title hint-text no-margin">Newsletter data</h5>

<p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>

<p>The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration form is based exclusively on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<p>The data you provide us with for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the purpose has ceased to exist. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO.</p>

<p>After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist, if necessary, in order to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO). The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</p>
