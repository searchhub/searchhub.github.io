# Searchhub Basic Training - How do I Merge Clusters?

This video will introduce how to merge clusters using our category and filter selection tools.

Navigate to the _transformations_ heading and then to _query cluster_.
  
The top of our clusters list, shows how many clusters search|hub has already created, autonomously. 

Over two hundred fifty-thousand! Work you don’t have to do.

Additionally, search|hub finds clusters, which could be potential matches however, we are still missing relevant business KPIs to make a valid decision regarding which clusters will perform well economically. 

To assist you in this, we have implemented our „merge clusters“ button. It’s located at the very top of our list of clusters. 

Click on the _merge clusters_ button to activate this now.

Now, you’ll see checkboxes appear to the left of each cluster. This will allow you to select clusters you wish to merge together.

The internal search can now be used to hone in on things such as brand names, categories, colors, and any number of other attributes. Use this flexibility to optimize in a way, in line, with how your customers are already searching for top-level product information. 

## Example:
** Bosch **
- Search for Bosch.
	- combine the 2nd and 5th entries
These are essentially the same thing.

_Staubsauger Bosch_  und _Bosch Staubsauger_ - combining these two clusters also combines their respective variants. 

The Staubsauger Bosch Cluster is now formed using the 3 variants from Staubsauger Bosch and the 5 variants from Bosch Staubsauger. 

Click on the respective clusters to show their variants

Click on „Save“.

Click _Show Target Cluster_ to preview changes.

search|hub will now use KPIs, such as _revenue, search frequency, click-through rate, and how often it has been used to add a product to the basket,_ in order to choose a new Master Query that best fits both or all clusters. 

For this example, search|hub has automatically defined _Staubsauger Bosch_ as the best-performing master query for these combined clusters. It’s marked in the searchhub interface in the color _red_

Following a merger you will clearly see, In the middle column where all clusters are listed, the combined totals for search frequency, as well as, the total number of variants contained within a given cluster. 

To delete a manually entered filter from the search box and continue training the system, simply click the _red „x“_ to the right of the query within the search box, in the middle column of the searchhub UI. 

Additionally, I may want to use a pre-defined filter to quickly get a handle on my search optimization workflow. For example, using a filter to hide already merged clusters, show master queries with high, or low exit rates etc. 
_we will go into this in more detail in our next video_ „Using the Fingerprint Button and Pre-Defined Filters“.

## What do the Yellow Tabs or Flags to the Left of the Queries mean?
These yellow flags indicate queries that you have actively made optimizations to within the last day. 

## How do I Deploy Changes to my Search Engine?

Click on _Deployment_ in the left-hand navigation menu. This will list all _optimizations_ done within searchhub since the last deployment. 

You may either deploy changes to your search-engine immediately or leave the system as is, and it will automatically deploy changes overnight.

## Summary
### How do I Merge Clusters?
This functionality allows you to merge similar clusters using our category and filter selection tools.

This video will introduce _how to use the fingerprint button to confirm highly similar clusters identified by search|hub_, as well as, using pre-defined filters to more specifically focus optimization efforts. 

Navigate to the _transformations_ heading and then to _query cluster_.

Click on the _merge clusters_ button at the top of the middle column to activate this functionality.

Searchhub scientifically builds compelling business cases before autonomously merging clusters. 

As a result, we have designed searchhub to give merger suggestions, which you can confirm using our fingerprint tool.

## How to use Pre-Defined Filters to focus on a Set of Clusters?
For this example: use the pre-defined filter _high exit rate_ found at the top-right of the middle column of our UI, behind the button _all clusters_.

Now look for anything unusual or obvious low-hanging fruit.

Immediately I notice:
_Seit Bord_.

It sounds like **_Sideboard_**. 

Make sure the _merge clusters_ button remains activated. You will know this is the case by the small checkboxes to the left of all queries once activated. 

Now click on _All Clusters_ at the top of the middle column and search for the term _sideboard_.

This naturally produces a match.

Combine the _seit bord_ and _sideboard_ clusters. This is an example of low-hanging fruit. A German phonetic spelling error frequently found. 
In this way, pre-defined filters help to organize and target your optimization workflow.

## What is the Purpose Behind the Fingerprint Function?
How would you go about identifying potential cluster matches for variations you never would have thought of?

That’s what our fingerprint function is used for.

For this example, we return to the query _sideboard_. 

Make sure the _merge clusters_ button at the top of the middle column is still activated.

Click on the query _sideboard_. You will see the _fingerprint_ symbol in the right-hand portion of the searchhub UI flash three times. 

Click on the _fingerprint_ button now!

A window opens with a list of _clusters, sorted according to relevance_.\_ 
Now, confirm all fitting query variations into the larger \_sideboard\_cluster. 

When finished click on _close_, then _save_ in the upper right-hand corner.

Again we have created a larger target cluster combining all variants and search data from all the combined clusters under one master query. 


## What do the Yellow Tabs or Flags to the Left of the Queries mean?
These yellow flags indicate queries which you have actively made optimizations to within the last day. 

## How do I Deploy Changes to my Search Engine?

Click on _Deployment_ in the left-hand navigation menu. This will list all _optimizations_ done within searchhub since the last deployment. 

You may either deploy changes to your search-engine immediately or leave the system as is, and it will automatically deploy changes overnight.

## Summary
### Using the Fingerprint Button and Pre-Defined Filters
This function allows you to confirm highly similar clusters identified by search|hub.

|KPI |Explanation |  
|--|--|  
|#Searches |*Total Unique Searches* is the number of times visitors performed an initial search on your site. Duplicate searches within a single visit are excluded.|  
|Category |The most represented Product-Category for products bought in relation to a search term. (This needs some Sort of Identifier (ProductID or URL) that maps a Result Pageview to SKU data (in this case the category))|
|Clicks |The amount of unique result Pageviews per session.|  
|CR |Number of unique orders per session divided by the number of unique searches per session.|  
|CTR |Number of unique product detail page impressions per session divided by the number of unique searches per session.|  
|Exit rate |Number of exits per session divided by the number of unique searches per session.|  
|Exits |The number of exits from your site that occurred following an initial result from your site-search.|  
|Findability™ |The *findability™* represents a weighted rate between positive and negative user signals for a given Search Term. *Negative signals* are **exits**, **bounces**, **no-clicks** and **long search paths**. *Positive signals* are **clicks**, **rate of clicks** on the first page of results, **carts** and **buys**.|  
|Human rate |Number of unique searches per session that could be identified as searches issued by users and not bots, referral-links, campaigns, etc. devided by the number of all unique searches per session.|

|Orders |The total number of completed purchases on your site.|
